These are some of the open source projects that I am currently working on.

Gina
----

Gina is an XMPP bot written in Python that leverages off the excellent <a title="Twisted" href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac" target="_blank" onclick="pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/twistedmatrix.com/trac?referer=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.geek.sh%2Fabout%2F');">Twisted</a> library. It allows you to subscribe to your RSS/Atom feeds which are sent to you whenever a feed updates along with the summary of the update.Â  It is built around a plugin style architecture that makes it really easy to write your own plugins to extend functionality. There is also the humble beginning of an alarm / reminder plugin.
