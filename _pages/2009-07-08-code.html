These are some of the open source projects that I am currently working on.

<strong>Gina</strong>

Gina is an XMPP bot written in Python that leverages off the excellent <a title="Twisted" href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac" target="_blank">Twisted</a> library. It allows you to subscribe to your RSS/Atom feeds which are sent to you whenever a feed updates along with the summary of the update.Â  It is built around a plugin style architecture that makes it really easy to write your own plugins to extend functionality. There is also the humble beginning of an alarm / reminder plugin.

<strong>Thoth</strong>

Thoth is a pastebin with IRC integration.   Thoth is written in Python and makes use of the Twisted, Nevow and Axiom libraries. This project is still relatively new so there is only a basic implementation so far.
