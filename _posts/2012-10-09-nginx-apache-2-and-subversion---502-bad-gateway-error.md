### The Problem

I recently ran into this problem and couldn't find any useful information on
the net around fixing it. All subversion checkouts, commits and other basic
operations work just fine, but when attempting to copy, move or tag (copy) I
would get the below (502 Bad Gateway) error.

    greg@codemine:~/code/Foo (git-svn)-[trunk] %> git svn tag foo-2.1.1                      
    Copying https://svn/projects/Foo/trunk at r18311 to https://svn/projects/Foo/tags/foo-2.1.1...
    RA layer request failed: Server sent unexpected return value (502 Bad Gateway) in response to COPY request for '/projects/!svn/bc/18311/Foo/trunk' at /usr/libexec/git-core/git-svn line 1123

### Our Setup

We have a machine running nginx on port 80 (and 443 SSL) that serves up a bunch
of development tools - buildbots, Jenkins, git repos and of course a few
subversion repos.

The subversion repository uses WebDAV / DAV SVN and is served up via Apache 2.
nginx simply reverse proxies requests to the backend Apache 2 servers and
handles the SSL termination as our repos are only available over SSL (https).

### What's Really Happening

The actual problem is not really that obvious.

When you perform a remote svn operation like MOVE or COPY the actual request is
translated into a WebDAV operation that looks similar to this:

    COPY /svn/repos/oldname.txt HTTP/1.1
    Host: svn.example.org
    Destination: https://svn.example.org/svn/repos/newname.txt

Apache, the webserver, translates the above request to:

    COPY https://svn.example.org/svn/repos/oldname.txt https://svn.example.org/svn/repos/newname.txt
    
It uses the Host parameter *svn.example.org* and the first request line `COPY
/svn/repos/oldname.txt HTTP/1.1` to assemble the source URL,
`https://svn.example.org/svn/repos/oldname.txt`.

However, since requests are being reverse proxied through nginx, the source URL
is changed from https:// to http:// as Apache listens on port 80 (HTTP). This
results in a COPY operation that looks like this:

    COPY http://svn.example.org/svn/repos/oldname.txt https://svn.example.org/svn/repos/newname.txt

*Note the http:// instead of https://*

Apache quickly figures out that it can't move a file http://svn.example.org/svn/repos/oldname.txt to https://svn.example.org/svn/repos/newname.txt, because as far as Apache is concerned http://svn.example.org/ and https://svn.example.org/ are two entirely different hosts.

... and you end up with a "502 Bad Gateway" error.

### The Solution

The solution to this problem is getting nginx to change the Destination header
in the same way it changes the Host header. Apache can then handle the COPY or
MOVE operation correctly. This is done by adding the following to your nginx
configuration:

    set $fixed_destination $http_destination;  
    if ( $http_destination ~* ^https(.*)$ ) {  
        set $fixed_destination http$1;  
    }  
    proxy_set_header Destination $fixed_destination;  

### Complete Configs

For reference purposes I've included the complete configs below.

*/etc/nginx/sites-available/svn.example.org*

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name svn.example.org;
        rewrite ^(.*) https://svn.example.org$1 permanent;
    }

    server {
        listen 443;
        server_name svn.example.org;

        ssl on;
        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/conf.d/svn.example.org.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/conf.d/svn.example.org.key;
        ssl_verify_depth 3;

        client_max_body_size 100m;
        access_log /var/log/nginx/svn.example.org-access.log;

        location / {
            set $fixed_destination $http_destination;
            if ( $http_destination ~* ^https(.*)$ ) {
                set $fixed_destination http$1;
            }
            proxy_set_header Destination $fixed_destination;
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;

            proxy_pass http://localhost:9080;
            proxy_connect_timeout 75;
            proxy_read_timeout 300;
            proxy_send_timeout 300;
        }
    }

*/etc/apache2/sites-available/svn.example.org*

    <VirtualHost *:9080>
        ServerName svn.example.org
        ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/svn.example.org-error.log
        <Location />
            DAV svn
            DAVMinTimeout 0
            SVNParentPath /home/svn
            AuthType Basic
            AuthName "Subversion Repos"
