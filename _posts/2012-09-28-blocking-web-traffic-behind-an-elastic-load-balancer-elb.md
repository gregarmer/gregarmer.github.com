Over the past few hours we've been on the receiving end of a fairly large scale
set of web requests (read: attack) to a website we host over on Amazon EC2. Our
setup is not really that complicated, however we encountered a problem that
wasn't that easy to solve.

### Our Setup

So we have an [Elastic Load Balancer][1] out in front, that sends on web requests to
a set of web servers. These web servers are in an auto-scaling group and simply
run [nginx][2]. They then pass traffic onto a set of load balanced application
servers. Nothing really out of the ordinary here.

The entire setup lives inside a [VPC][3] so these server have no direct access to
the internet, and specific traffic is NAT'd out another gateway.

### The Problem

We narrowed down the attack to a set of IPs all originating from the same
netblock. These requests were largely made up of SQL injection attacks, along
with some other crazy requests designed to attempt to execute *nix commands.

The requests looked like this:

    208.96.18.11 "GET /results/2011%27%20OR%20%271%27%3D%271/11/ HTTP/1.1" "Mozilla/5.0"
    208.96.18.11 "GET /results/2011)%20OR%201%3D(1/11/ HTTP/1.1" "Mozilla/5.0"
    208.96.18.11 "GET /results/2011%27)%20OR%20%271%27%3D(%271/11/ HTTP/1.1" "Mozilla/5.0"
    208.96.18.11 "GET /results/2011%27%20OR%201%3D1%20%23/11/ HTTP/1.1" "Mozilla/5.0"
    208.96.18.11 "GET /results/2011%27)%20AND%20%271%27%20in%20(%270/11/ HTTP/1.1" "Mozilla/5.0"

and without the URL encoding:

    208.96.18.11 "GET /results/2011' OR '1'='1/11/ HTTP/1.1" "Mozilla/5.0"
    208.96.18.11 "GET /results/2011) OR 1=(1/11/ HTTP/1.1" "Mozilla/5.0"
    208.96.18.11 "GET /results/2011') OR '1'=('1/11/ HTTP/1.1" "Mozilla/5.0"
    208.96.18.11 "GET /results/2011' OR 1=1 #/11/ HTTP/1.1" "Mozilla/5.0"
    208.96.18.11 "GET /results/2011') AND '1' in ('0/11/ HTTP/1.1" "Mozilla/5.0"

*(Yes, that's one of the actual IPs attacking us.)*

So the obvious move here is to block traffic from the offending IPs, right ?

Unfortunately that's simply not possible with an ELB, as the only control you have
over the traffic is through a [security group][4]. However, the security group only
lets you control *allow* rules, so to block a specific IP you'd need to
explicitly allow traffic from all other IPs on the internet. This is simply not
feasible.

You can't block the traffic with a firewall on the web servers either, as
the traffic hitting the web servers has the source IP address of the load
balancer. The only access you have to the real source IP at the web server
level is in the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header inside that actual requests.

### Blocking the Traffic

The best you can do in this scenario is to block all requests at the actual
web servers. In our case on nginx this was as simple as adding the following
directives to the *server* block:

    set_real_ip_from 172.16.10.9;         // Our ELB
    real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;       // The real IP from the ELB
    deny 208.96.18.11;                    // Have some HTTP 403

This doesn't stop the traffic at all, it simply returns HTTP 403's to any
requests from the IP addresses or netblock listed. This does take the load off
the application servers though, and since nginx is quite efficient at returning
403's with little resource usage, we can serve them up nice and quickly.
It would still be nice to firewall that traffic entirely, and hopefully,
someday, Amazon adds the ability to configure *allow* __and__ *deny* rules in
security groups.
