title: The basics of ZFS ACLs
category: UNIX / Linux
---
This post was mostly inspired by reading <a href="http://www.1stbyte.com/2009/07/24/zfs-cifs-and-acl-inheritance/">this post</a> in trying to get my head around the ZFS ACL and permission system.

Basically I have a pool set out as follows:
<pre>
tank
tank/media
tank/zones
</pre>

tank/media is served via CIFS and NFS to multiple clients on my network, each with their own unix account on the OpenSolaris server. tank/zones is used for extra zones running on the host.

Everything was working great until I found that files and directories created by clients ended up looking like this:
<pre>
----------  1 greg staff 734310400 2009-07-18 19:10 foo.txt
d---------  2 greg staff        19 2008-12-06 14:10 Bar
</pre>

This sure didn't go down well when other users needed to access those files or directories.

So in following the above mentioned post I did this:
<pre>
 # zfs set aclinherit=passthrough tank/media
 # zfs set aclmode=passthrough tank/media
 # /bin/chmod 0774 /tank/media
 # /bin/chmod -R A- /tank/media
 # /bin/chmod -R A=owner@:full_set:fd:allow /tank/media
 # /bin/chmod -R A+group@:full_set:fd:allow /tank/media
 # /bin/chmod -R A+everyone@:read_set:fd:allow /tank/media
</pre>

A better description of what the flags / syntax mean can be found <a href="http://dlc.sun.com/osol/docs/content/ZFSADMIN/gbace.html">here</a> and <a href="http://dlc.sun.com/osol/docs/content/ZFSADMIN/gbacb.html">here</a>

A simple breakdown:
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
        <li>First off, we tell ZFS that all files or directories must inherit all acls / permissions from their parent.</li>
	<li>We use /bin/chmod as the chmod in the default path is the GNU chmod which does not understand ZFS acls.</li>
	<li>The second chmod "A-" will remove all acls currently set on the object.</li>
	<li>We then set the owners permission to the "full_set", thus giving the owner all possible permissions.</li>
	<li>We do the same for the group.</li>
	<li>Finally, we give everyone else read access.</li>
</ul>
