As you may have noticed, I've replaced the old theme here on my blog with something a little cleaner and simpler. I couldn't really find anything I liked or wanted on the net, so I threw something simple together using <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Twitters excellent Bootstrap library</a> along with a little help from <a href="http://bootswatch.com/" target="_blank">Bootswatch</a>.

If you'd like a copy to use or adapt, you can grab it from <a href="https://github.com/gregarmer/wp-codegeek" target="_blank">https://github.com/gregarmer/wp-codegeek</a>. Beware though, it is by no means a complete Wordpress theme and only handles my specific requirements at this point.
